**Project #1 – Python Average Calculator
**A Python program built to practice core programming concepts and gain hands‑on experience with Git and GitHub workflows. Developed independently to strengthen skills in functions, loops, and unit testing while maintaining clean code structure and documentation.

Features
Prompts the user for three integers (positive, negative, or zero)

Calculates the average (with decimals) of the three values

Compares each number to the average (above, below, or equal)

Loops until a special input ends the program and outputs the total sets processed

Includes unit tests for all major functions

**Tools & Environment
**Language: Python 3.x

Testing: pytest or Python unittest

Version Control: Git + GitHub


**How to Run: **
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the program
python main.py
3. Run the tests
python -m unittest discover tests

**Lessons Learned:
**
- Practiced writing clean, modular functions with comments and docstrings.

- Gained hands‑on experience with Git (commits, branches, pushing to GitHub).

- Learned how to write and organize unit tests.
